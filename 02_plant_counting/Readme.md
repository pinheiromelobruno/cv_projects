# Introduction:

The Plant Counting Project aims to count individual plants using geospatial raster data. By utilizing image processing techniques and Python libraries such as rasterio, numpy, matplotlib, and OpenCV, the project provides a method to identify and count plants in an image. The project focuses on the analysis of geospatial data obtained from drone imagery.

## Project Steps:

### Preliminary:

* Installing Rasterio: The Rasterio library is installed to access geospatial raster data. Run the following command to install it: !pip install rasterio.
Importing Libraries: The necessary libraries are imported for the analysis, including rasterio, numpy, matplotlib, cv2, and skimage.
* Mounting Google Drive: To access the geospatial raster image file, Google Drive is mounted. This step enables the notebook to access the required image file.
* Opening the Image File: The script opens the geospatial raster image file using the rasterio library. The image is converted to a NumPy array and then converted to the uint8 data type, making it compatible with OpenCV.
* Displaying the Image: The loaded image is displayed using matplotlib.pyplot.imshow to visualize the geospatial raster image.
* Applying Vegetation Index: The script calculates a vegetation index (ExG) based on the RGB channels of the image. The vegetation index helps enhance areas of the image that contain vegetation.
* Binarization: The script applies a bimodal histogram thresholding technique to generate a binary image. This process separates vegetation and non-vegetation areas in the image.
* Displaying the Binary Image: The resulting binary image is displayed using matplotlib.pyplot.imshow to visualize the binary representation of the image.
* Converting to 0 and 1: The binary image is converted to a 0-1 representation by casting it as uint8.
* Morphological Operations: The script applies morphological operations, such as erosion and dilation, to the binary image. These operations help reduce the area around each plant and refine the plant boundaries.
* Displaying the Processed Image: The processed image, after applying morphological operations, is displayed using matplotlib.pyplot.imshow to visualize the refined plant boundaries.
* Counting: The connectedComponents function from OpenCV is used to assign a unique index to each individual plant in the image. The count of individual plants is determined by the number of unique indices.
* Final Output: The final count of individual plants is obtained from the connected components analysis.

## Conclusion:
The Plant Counting Project demonstrates the process of counting individual plants using geospatial raster data. By following the outlined steps and utilizing image processing techniques, it provides a method to identify and count plants in an image. The project is particularly useful for analyzing drone imagery and assessing plant populations in various applications, such as agriculture, forestry, and environmental studies.
